calculate occlusion map from the sky, with orthographic projection

To calculate fp, need:
normal, up, noise for f_inc
occlusion map, depth for f_e

deferred vertex shader:
calculate fp and distort vertex according to fp

deferred fragment shader:
calculate fp
distort normal
calculate color of pixel
